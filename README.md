## C/C++ Low-level game code (ongoing)

### Notes

- Repository is not built around supporting different run-time configurations.

### Low-level game code

This project is the combined effort of learning to develop a relatively simple game in C/C++ without
the use of any libraries, including a graphics API like OpenGL. This involves software-based rendering,
managing custom windowing code + back-buffer memory, custom memory management, audio wave logic, etc.

This project is a follow-up/educational project on the videos/streams provided by [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

### Features

- Software-based renderer
- Manual Win32 window/input management
- Custom memory allocation
- Audio sine wave generics
